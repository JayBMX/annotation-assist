The new app, powered by the cognitive computing technology behind IBM's Watson system which prevailed on Jeopardy! and Bon Appetit's 9,000 recipes and culinary knowledge, allows home cooks to create entirely new recipes based on novel combinations of flavors and textures that have never been conceived. IBM is applying the same cognitive technology behind Chef Watson to reinvent how discoveries are made in other fields, including healthcare, financial services and retail.

The demonstration brought together Watson's learning and natural language capabilities with top chefs to delight the palates of local attendees.

Chef Watson represents another example of the versatility of the technology and the diverse ways in which Watson will change our lives.</p><p>&quot;We're partnering with Bon Appetit to put Watson initially into the hands of a small group of people who have a passion for cooking, a desire to experiment and who want to be a part of something ground breaking,&quot; said Mike Rhodin, Senior Vice President, IBM Watson Group. &quot;Our goal is to help people discover the potential of cognitive computing systems. These systems can understand vast amounts of data, compounds, and formulas as well as learn from interactions with people and information, in a far more intuitive way.&quot;</p><p>Chef Watson will initially be available to a select group of Bon Appetit's readers, building on the success of Chef Watson in the Bon Appetit Test Kitchen.
