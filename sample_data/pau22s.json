As it formulates a response, Watson applies advanced analytics to generate hypotheses, weigh and evaluate relevant evidence, and identify the information that is most likely to be useful. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_cqBP08yuA.Watson is not a search engine. Search engines become less accurate as more information is introduced to the search. Search engines scan the internet for content; some good, some bad. Search relies on factors such as keywords to bring up thousands of web pages that may - or may not -- hold the answer to what a user is asking. Watson is able to leverage additional information to become increasingly precise. Companies today have an abundance of information, most of it in an unstructured form that is not stored in database rows and columns and is therefore unusable by most traditional computing systems. Watson can help you to extract meaning from big data. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np1sJ08Q7lw.",

The team dubbed the system Watson as a tribute to the founder of the International Business Machines Corporation, Thomas J. Watson.In February 2011, the team realized their goal and exceeded expectations when Watson appeared on Jeopardy! and beat the two highest ranked players in a two-game match. The competition was the ultimate test of the machine's capabilities because it relied on many human cognitive abilities that are traditionally considered to be beyond the capability of computers, such as:- Discern double meanings of words, puns, rhymes, and inferred hints.- Respond rapidly.- Process vast amounts of information to make complex and subtle logical connections.For the Watson team, replicating these capabilities was an enormous challenge, because it moved beyond keyword searches and queries of structured data to accessing and assessing a vast amount of unstructured data to find the best answers. IBM knew that the solution to this challenge had the potential to change the way businesses use information and make decisions. And the transformation has begun.",
