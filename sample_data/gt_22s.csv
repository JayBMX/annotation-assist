1000014454,what is a watson," <p>IBM Watson is an analytical computing system that specializes in understanding the meaning of questions posed in natural human language and that draws on a broad domain of knowledge to respond quickly.
</p><p>Watson is a cognitive technology that helps augment and scale expertise by processing information more like a human than a computer by understanding natural language -- real language that is not specially designed and encoded just for computers, but language that humans use to capture and communicate knowledge. As it formulates a response, Watson applies advanced analytics to generate hypotheses, weigh and evaluate relevant evidence, and identify the information that is most likely to be useful. See <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_cqBP08yuA%2522%20%5Co%20%2522(Opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab%20or%20window)%2522%20%5Ct%20%2522_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_cqBP08yuA</a>.
</p><p>Watson is not a search engine. Search engines become less accurate as more information is introduced to the search. Search engines scan the internet for content; some good, some bad. Search relies on factors such as keywords to bring up thousands of web pages that may - or may not -- hold the answer to what a user is asking. Watson is able to leverage additional information to become increasingly precise. Companies today have an abundance of information, most of it in an unstructured form that is not stored in database rows and columns and is therefore unusable by most traditional computing systems. Watson can help you to extract meaning from big data.

1000070393,how is discovery advisor helping drug companes," <p>Watson Discovery Advisor is an application that researchers can use to find patterns and discover connections within a large data set.
</p><p>The Discovery Advisor is not a traditional question answering application. Rather, the goal of the Discovery Advisor is to return passages from the knowledge base that serve as evidence for the top answers to a question, and to enable those passages to be explored. A researcher can delve further into the knowledge base by proposing an alternate answer that he knows or that he finds within a returned passage. When the alternate answer is submitted to Watson evidence passages that relate to both the original question and the asserted answer are returned. By repeating this process, the researcher can chain together a series of passages that support a line of inquiry, in effect enabling him to test a hypothesis or formulate a new one.
